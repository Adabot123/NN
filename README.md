Welcome or welcome back to the Deep Dive into AI tutorial series where I go deep into the fundamentals of neural networks (specifically large language models) through the bottom-up approach!

I will be referencing a lot from Andrej Karpathy’s series on Neural Networks: Zero to Hero because I have found that it is one of the most practical and in-depth series on building neural networks. And as always, I’ll be breaking everything I learn into first principles through this series and sharing the useful life lessons along the way I have learned from programming!
